  abstract = {Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {Aqueous rechargeable batteries have received significant attention because of their low-cost and security. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (about 1.23 V) of the aqueous electrolyte sets a limit on their energy output. Herein, we have developed an aqueous rechargeable hybrid battery using Na2MnFe(CN)6 nanocubes as the cathode and a zinc metal sheet as the anode, which delivered a high energy density of 170 W h kg-1 and a capacity retention of 75\% over 2000 cycles with an operating voltage of up to 2.0 V. By adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the aqueous electrolyte, the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte was expanded to about 2.5 V. The results of the experiments and calculations based on the density functional theory indicate that SDS can not only inhibit the decomposition of water, suppress the dissolution of Mn and the corrosion of zinc but also increase the cycle life and rate capability. The low-cost, high energy density, and long cycle life of the battery suggest that it is a promising candidate for energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Qualitative and quantitative analyses of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants, such as polyphenols, by simple electrochemical measurements were conducted in a bicontinuous microemulsion (BME), in which water and oil phases coexisted bicontinuously on a microscopic scale. Hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants were individually monitored in the same BME solution using a hydrophilic indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and a lipophilic fluorinated nanocarbon film electrode (F-ECR), respectively. The combination of well-balanced BME and extremely biased electrodes, such as ITO and F-ECR, in terms of hydrophilic\textendash{}lipophilic balance allowed us to achieve individual monitoring of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in the same BME solution without extraction. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of functional liquid foods, such as coffee and olive oil, were also evaluated by means of electrochemical measurements in BME solutions containing analytes in concentrations of several percent. The technique we propose provides a very simple, rapid, easily serviceable, and highly reproducible analysis and can be extended to a wide range of analytes and media.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical and catalytic properties of vitamin B12 hexacarboxylate-polylysine films covalently immobilized onto pyrolytic graphite electrodes were controlled by microemulsion composition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in microemulsions and micellar solutions is incorporated to form micelles within the cationic films. This changes the net film charge from positive, characteristic of the protonated lysines, to negative, characteristic of SDS micelles. Micelle formation was supported by voltammetry and quartz crystal microbalance results, which also suggested that cationic surfactants do not enter the film. Catalytic turnover rates for the reduction of dibromocyclohexane to cyclohexene mediated by the film in SDS microemulsions were controlled by the difference between the reduction potential of the reactant and the catalyst E\textdegree{}` in the film. Thus, reaction rate in these systems is controlled by the intrinsic activation free energy. For a given reactant, catalyst E\textdegree{}`, and consequently activation free energy, can be controlled by microemulsion composition via interactions of surfactant and salt with the polymer network. Fast catalyst turnover was also facilitated by high conductivity and low viscosity of the bulk microemulsion.},

  abstract = {Microemulsions are clear microheterogeneous fluids made from water, oil, and surfactant. They provide cheaper and less toxic alternatives to organic solvents. In this paper, we review progress in understanding reaction dynamics and designing mediated electrochemical syntheses in microemulsions. Rates of mediated electrochemical reactions in conductive microemulsions can be enhanced by preconcentration of reactants in a dynamic film on the electrode surface, or more generally by controlling the formal potential of the mediator in the fluid. The electrode|fluid interface in microemulsions probably consists of a dynamic layer of surfactant molecules packed more loosely on the electrode than in aqueous micellar solutions. Microemulsions afforded good yields of carbon\textendash{}carbon addition products in reactions mediated by the cobalt complex vitamin B12. Excellent stereoselective control in microemulsions made with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was demonstrated for the catalytic cyclization of 2-(4-bromobutyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-one to 1-decalone. Electrochemical synthesis in microemulsions may be a viable future approach to environmentally friendly methods of producing organic chemicals.},

  abstract = {Electrolysis in microemulsions is a promising approach for environmentally friendly chemical synthetic methods of the future. Employing microemulsions instead of organic solvents for electrosynthesis has the advantages of lower toxicity and cost, high dissolving power for reactants and mediators of unlike solubility, enhancement of reaction rates by controlling the reduction potentials of mediators, possible reaction pathway control, and recycling of microemulsion components. This paper reviews recent progress in using microemulsions for direct and mediated electrosynthesis, including formation of carbon\-carbon bonds. Rates of mediated reactions can be controlled by manipulating microemulsion composition. Examples are presented, in which reaction pathways of direct and mediated electrolyses can be controlled with microemulsions to give desired products in high yields. Such control has been demonstrated with dissolved and surface-bound mediators. For a covalently linked scaffold of poly(l-lysine) and cobalt corrin vitamin B12 hexacarboxylate attached to graphite, catalytic turnover rate for reduction of 1,2-dibromocylcohexane was optimized by optimizing microemulsion composition.},
